NOTICE: I do NOT guarantee anything on this connector.  It is up to you to ensure the fitment, rigidity, and design with your setup.  I take no ownership of any damage you may do.

NOTES ON CONNECTORS: Pricing shown is that at Shapeways.com for Fine Detail Plastic with Smoothest Finish.
Information on the material can be found here: https://www.shapeways.com/materials/fine-detail-plastic.
The polymer (for fine detail plastic) is a poly-acrylic that is rated for 176F (80C), but has poor UV resistance .
It is recommended that if you believe the connector may be exposed to sun light, to coat the outside of the connector in a UV-resistant coating such as Krylons UV-resistant clear coat (https://www.krylon.com/products/uvresistant-clear-coating/).
The .stl files have been optimized and are ready to be sent to a printing service.
The .skp are Sketchup files (version 2018 or later) that can be used to modify the connector if need be.
If you change the connector design, it is recommended to optimize the drawing using a service like those by MakePrintable (https://makeprintable.com/) to optimize the .stl.  You may find this optimization will reduce printing costs significantly.
